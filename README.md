## learning Github

This is just to practice how to write a markdown of a Readme file.

I am going to learn how to write a paragram, a list, and how to make a table.

1. let's make a list of elements for instance
  * blue line
  * orange line
    * black road 
2. make a table

| items | qty | price ($) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| orange | 25 | .35 |
